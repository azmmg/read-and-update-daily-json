CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the four basic operations that can be performed on data in most database systems and applications:

Create: Adding new data
Read: Retrieving existing data
Update: Modifying existing data
Delete: Removing existing data

These operations are fundamental to data management and are used in various contexts, from database queries to API design.
